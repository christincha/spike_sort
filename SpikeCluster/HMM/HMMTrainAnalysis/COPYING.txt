Mixed-state Markov model for spike train analysis

Neurons can have rapidly changing spike train statistics dictated by the underlying network excitability or behavioral state of an animal. To estimate the time course of such state dynamics from single- or multiple neuron recordings, we have developed an algorithm that maximizes the likelihood of observed spike trains by optimizing the state lifetimes and the state-conditional interspike-interval (ISI) distributions. Our algorithm is free of time-binning and spike-counting problems and has the computational complexity of a Mixed-state Markov Model operating on a state sequence with length equal to the total number of recorded spikes.
